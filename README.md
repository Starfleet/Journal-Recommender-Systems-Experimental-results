### Do Journal Recommender Systems really support the process of selecting the best journal for submitting a research article?

#### by Blanca Miranda-Valencia and Salvador Godoy-Calderon

Which has the following abstract:

> Selecting the ideal journal for submitting the most recent research
> article is a complex decision for any researcher. In order to assist
> in that task, publishers offer Journal Recommender Systems (JRS). In
> this paper we analyze six JRS from several publishing houses
> (Elsevier, Springer Nature, MDPI, Taylor & Francis, Wiley, and IEEE)
> and compare their recommendations with those from Clarivate's JRS
> which is not a publishing house but an indexing and bibliographic
> collection organization. We designed an experiment in which 350
> previously published articles, from 70 journals are used to query each
> of the JRS. Experimental results show a set of inconsistencies in the
> behavior of JRS, like the fact that none was able to identify that the
> queried articles had already been published, some times the original
> journal where the queried article was published was not even part of
> the recommendations issued by the JRS from the same publisher, and
> that their recommendations do not always comply with the user's
> intended article scope. Those inconsistencies allow us to draw several
> conclusions about the purpose and operation of the JRS, as well as
> some reflections on the process of publication.

As in any other factual experiment, there is a potentially large number
of aspects that can be tabulated and graphed from the raw list of
recommendations collected. Although the following section reports only a
few notable results that we consider noteworthy, all of the results
obtained during this experiment are available for the general public in
this repository*.*
